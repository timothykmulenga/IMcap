# IMcap
Inspired from the paper "Show Attend and Tell". This project's aim is to train a neural network which can provide descriptive text for a given image.


## Overview
Architecture bascially consists of encoder-decoder Neural Network, where encoder extracts feature from the image and decoder interprets those features to produce sentence.

Encoder consists of a pre-trained Inception-V3 model (minus the last Fully Connected layers) appended by a custom Fully Connected layer.
Decoder consists of LSTM along with visual-attention. Visual attention helps LSTM in focussing on relevent image features for the prediction of a particular word in word sequence (sentence)

For word embeddings, a custom word2vec model was trained and it was then intersected with Google's pre-trained word2vec model.

Google-colab and google drive combo was used for training the model.
Flickr30 Dataset was used for creating train and test sets.

A number of models were trained (each trained on different no of images). Of these, version 5 model performs the best.
You can access these models from "models" sub-directory inside "ImageCap" directory
